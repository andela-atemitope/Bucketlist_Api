### Bucketlist
A list of activities someone wants to do before they die is often called a bucket list, because it is a list of things a person wants to do before they "kick the bucket."
This API provides the features for a bucketlist via a RESTFUL API which uses JSON Web Tokens(JWT) for its Authenticaton. 

Kindly refer to `http://bucketlist-api.herokuapp.com` to view the full documentation for this RESTFUL API
